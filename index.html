      <h2>How I Prompt AI to Learn History</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">AI is the ultimate study partner — if you know how to ask. Here's how I use large language models to explore historical topics quickly and deeply.</p>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Start Broad, Then Narrow</h3>
          <p>I begin with a wide prompt like <em>"Give me an overview of the causes of the Thirty Years' War"</em> and then follow up with targeted questions: <em>"Which specific event in Prague triggered the conflict?"</em> This mimics how bee questions work — they start with context clues and narrow to a specific answer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Ask for "Bee-Style" Questions</h3>
          <p>I prompt the AI directly: <em>"Write 5 National History Bee-style tossup questions about the Renaissance."</em> Then I practice answering them before reading the full answer. This builds the skill of buzzing in at the right moment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Use the "Explain Like a Story" Technique</h3>
          <p>History sticks when it's a narrative. I ask: <em>"Tell me the story of the fall of Constantinople as if it were a thriller."</em> Memorable stories create memorable answers under pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cross-Reference and Verify</h3>
          <p>AI can sometimes get details wrong. I always follow up with: <em>"What are the key dates and names I should double-check?"</em> and then verify against reliable sources. This habit has saved me from memorizing incorrect information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Build Connections Between Topics</h3>
          <p>Bee questions often link different eras or regions. I ask: <em>"What connections exist between the Silk Road and the spread of the Black Death?"</em> These cross-topic prompts reveal the kinds of surprising links that show up in competition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>My Go-To Prompt Template</h3>
          <div class="prompt-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> "I'm studying for the National History Bee. Give me a detailed but concise summary of [TOPIC], focusing on: key people, key dates, causes, consequences, and any surprising or commonly-tested facts. Then write 3 bee-style tossup questions about it."</p>

  <!-- Section 2: Wikipedia Deep Dives -->
  <section id="wikipedia" class="section section-dark">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="section-icon">📚</div>
      <h2>Using Wikipedia to Find Relevance &amp; Go Deep</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Wikipedia is an underrated superpower for bee prep. Here's my system for turning it into a structured study tool.</p>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>The "See Also" Rabbit Hole</h3>
          <p>Every Wikipedia article has a "See also" section at the bottom. I use this to map out related topics. If I'm reading about the Treaty of Westphalia, the "See also" links might lead me to the Peace of Augsburg, which leads to the Diet of Worms. This chain-reading mirrors how bee questions connect concepts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Read the First Paragraph — Then Stop</h3>
          <p>The first paragraph of any Wikipedia article is almost always the most information-dense. For bee prep, I read that first paragraph carefully, note the bolded terms and key dates, then decide if I need to go deeper. This is efficient studying.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Use the "Did You Know" and "Featured Articles"</h3>
          <p>Wikipedia's main page features "Did you know" facts and featured articles. These often cover the kinds of obscure-but-fascinating topics that show up in bee competitions. I check these regularly for study inspiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Check "What Links Here"</h3>
          <p>Under the Tools menu, "What links here" shows every article that references the current page. This tells you how important and connected a topic is. If hundreds of articles link to a person or event, it's likely bee-relevant.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>The Category Tree Strategy</h3>
          <p>At the bottom of articles, Wikipedia lists categories. Clicking through these categories reveals entire topic clusters. For example, the category "Battles of World War I" gives you a structured list of every major and minor battle — perfect for systematic study.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Turn Articles Into Flashcards</h3>
          <p>After reading an article, I immediately create flashcards from the key facts. The Wikipedia article is the source, and my flashcard captures only what I'd need to answer a bee question. More on my flashcard method below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>The "Bee" Strategy: How I Compete</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Knowing history is only half the battle. The other half is performing under pressure. Here's my playbook for competition day.</p>

      <div class="strategy-grid">
        <div class="strategy-card">
          <div class="strategy-number">01</div>
          <h3>Buzz Timing Is Everything</h3>
          <p>Don't buzz the moment you think you know — buzz the moment you're <em>sure</em> you know. In early rounds, I play it safe and wait for confirming clues. In later rounds when points matter more, I get more aggressive. The key is reading the room and adjusting your risk tolerance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-card">
          <div class="strategy-number">02</div>
          <h3>Stay Calm With Box Breathing</h3>
          <p>Before each round, I do box breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. This lowers your heart rate and keeps your brain in "thinking mode" instead of "panic mode." I also do this between questions if I miss one.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-card">
          <div class="strategy-number">03</div>
          <h3>Forget the Last Question</h3>
          <p>If you miss a question or someone buzzes before you, let it go immediately. Dwelling on a mistake costs you the next question. I mentally say "next" and refocus. This is probably the hardest skill to learn, but it's the most important.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-card">
          <div class="strategy-number">04</div>
          <h3>Listen for Keyword Patterns</h3>
          <p>Bee questions follow patterns. Phrases like "this ruler," "this battle," or "this treaty" signal the answer type. Words like "first," "longest," or "only" are often critical qualifiers. I train myself to listen for these structural cues, not just content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-card">
          <div class="strategy-number">05</div>
          <h3>Use Process of Elimination</h3>
          <p>Even under pressure, I run through what the answer <em>can't</em> be. If the question mentions Asia and the 14th century, I can eliminate most European-focused answers. Narrowing the field makes educated guesses much more accurate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-card">
          <div class="strategy-number">06</div>
          <h3>Pre-Competition Routine</h3>
          <p>The night before: light review only, no cramming. Morning of: good breakfast, review my "weak topics" list for 20 minutes, then stop. At the venue: stay social and relaxed. Nervous energy is normal — channel it into focus, not fear.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="section-icon">🗂️</div>
      <h2>How I Make Flashcards for Memorization</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Flashcards are my #1 study tool, but most people make them wrong. Here's my system for cards that actually stick.</p>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>One Fact Per Card</h3>
          <p>Never put multiple facts on one card. <em>"Battle of Hastings — 1066 — William the Conqueror defeated Harold Godwinson"</em> should be THREE separate cards: one for the date, one for the victor, one for the defeated. This forces your brain to recall each fact independently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Write the Answer as a Bee Question</h3>
          <p>Instead of "Q: When was the Battle of Hastings?", I write: "Q: This 1066 battle saw a Norman duke defeat the last Anglo-Saxon king of England." The front of the card trains me in the same format I'll face in competition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Use Spaced Repetition</h3>
          <p>I use apps like Anki that automatically schedule reviews based on how well I know each card. Cards I struggle with appear more often; cards I've mastered appear less. This is scientifically proven to be the most efficient memorization method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Add Context Clues to the Back</h3>
          <p>The back of my card includes not just the answer but a one-line "memory hook" — a vivid image, a pun, or a connection to something I already know. For example: "Bastille — think 'BLAST the walls' — July 14, 1789." These hooks make recall faster under pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Color-Code by Era</h3>
          <p>I tag my cards by historical period: Ancient (blue), Medieval (green), Early Modern (orange), Modern (red), and American (purple). This helps me identify which eras I'm weak in and focus my study sessions accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Review in Competition Mode</h3>
          <p>Once a week, I time myself: 10 seconds per card, no peeking. If I can't answer in 10 seconds, it goes in the "needs work" pile. This simulates the pressure of having limited time to buzz in during a real bee.</p>
