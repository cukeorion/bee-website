      <h2>How I Prompt AI to Learn History</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">AI is the ultimate study partner — if you know how to ask. Here's how I use large language models to explore historical topics quickly and deeply.</p>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Start Broad, Then Narrow</h3>
          <p>I begin with a wide prompt like <em>"Give me an overview of the causes of the Thirty Years' War"</em> and then follow up with targeted questions: <em>"Which specific event in Prague triggered the conflict?"</em> This mimics how bee questions work — they start with context clues and narrow to a specific answer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Ask for "Bee-Style" Questions</h3>
          <p>I prompt the AI directly: <em>"Write 5 National History Bee-style tossup questions about the Renaissance."</em> Then I practice answering them before reading the full answer. This builds the skill of buzzing in at the right moment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Use the "Explain Like a Story" Technique</h3>
          <p>History sticks when it's a narrative. I ask: <em>"Tell me the story of the fall of Constantinople as if it were a thriller."</em> Memorable stories create memorable answers under pressure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cross-Reference and Verify</h3>
          <p>AI can sometimes get details wrong. I always follow up with: <em>"What are the key dates and names I should double-check?"</em> and then verify against reliable sources. This habit has saved me from memorizing incorrect information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Build Connections Between Topics</h3>
          <p>Bee questions often link different eras or regions. I ask: <em>"What connections exist between the Silk Road and the spread of the Black Death?"</em> These cross-topic prompts reveal the kinds of surprising links that show up in competition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>My Go-To Prompt Template</h3>
          <div class="prompt-box">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> "I'm studying for the National History Bee. Give me a detailed but concise summary of [TOPIC], focusing on: key people, key dates, causes, consequences, and any surprising or commonly-tested facts. Then write 3 bee-style tossup questions about it."</p>

  <section id="wikipedia" class="section section-dark">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="section-icon">📚</div>
      <h2>Using Wikipedia to Find Relevance &amp; Go Deep</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Wikipedia is an underrated superpower for bee prep. Here's my system for turning it into a structured study tool.</p>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>The "See Also" Rabbit Hole</h3>
          <p>Every Wikipedia article has a "See also" section at the bottom. I use this to map out related topics. If I'm reading about the Treaty of Westphalia, the "See also" links might lead me to the Peace of Augsburg, which leads to the Diet of Worms. This chain-reading mirrors how bee questions connect concepts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Read the First Paragraph — Then Stop</h3>
          <p>The first paragraph of any Wikipedia article is almost always the most information-dense. For bee prep, I read that first paragraph carefully, note the bolded terms and key dates, then decide if I need to go deeper. This is efficient studying.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Use the "Did You Know" and "Featured Articles"</h3>
          <p>Wikipedia's main page features "Did you know" facts and featured articles. These often cover the kinds of obscure-but-fascinating topics that show up in bee competitions. I check these regularly for study inspiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Check "What Links Here"</h3>
          <p>Under the Tools menu, "What links here" shows every article that references the current page. This tells you how important and connected a topic is. If hundreds of articles link to a person or event, it's likely bee-relevant.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>The Category Tree Strategy</h3>
          <p>At the bottom of articles, Wikipedia lists categories. Clicking through these categories reveals entire topic clusters. For example, the category "Battles of World War I" gives you a structured list of every major and minor battle — perfect for systematic study.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Turn Articles Into Flashcards</h3>
          <p>After reading an article, I immediately create flashcards from the key facts. The Wikipedia article is the source, and my flashcard captures only what I'd need to answer a bee question. More on my flashcard method below.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>The "Bee" Strategy: How I Compete</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Knowing history is only half the battle. The other half is performing under pressure. Here's my playbook for competition day.</p>

      <div class="strategy-list">
        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">01</div>
          <div><h3>Stay Engaged After Going Out</h3><p>If you reach the number of points you need to go "out" (you stop answering questions), don't zone out. Play along in your head to the remaining questions in the round, and write down topics that you missed.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">02</div>
          <div><h3>Use Regional and Time Period Clues</h3><p>Narrow down the answer using clues about regions and time periods. Pay attention to the names of people or places mentioned in the question. If most of the names sound like they are of a certain region in the world, the question is probably about that region. If an event which you know took place during a certain time period is mentioned, the question will probably be discussing that time period.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">03</div>
          <div><h3>Know What the Question Is Asking</h3><p>Listen closely for what the question is asking about. The question will say "this person", "this event", "this movement", etc. It is important to know what the question is asking for the first time it is mentioned, otherwise you may make a mistake in your answer despite knowing the material. For example, you could recognize a clue relating to Abraham Lincoln, but if the question was asking "this election" you might wrongly answer Lincoln instead of an election number such as 1860.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">04</div>
          <div><h3>Adjust Aggression by Round Type</h3><p>In preliminaries and regionals, be more aggressive when buzzing. If you have a good idea of what you think it might be, but are not 100% sure, you should still buzz in. In the national playoffs, you lose points for buzzing in with the wrong answer, so you should be more conservative and wait until you are almost certain that your answer will be correct.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">05</div>
          <div><h3>Buzz More When You're Behind</h3><p>Buzz in more when you are losing in the playoffs. If you get the right answer early on in the question, you get extra points in the national playoffs, so it is a good way to get out of a losing position.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">06</div>
          <div><h3>Buzz Even If You Need a Moment</h3><p>After a clue which you know the answer to but can't remember it immediately, you should still buzz. You have five seconds after buzzing to answer, so if you feel confident that the answer will come to you within that time, buzz so you can beat others to it.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">07</div>
          <div><h3>Remember Earlier Clues</h3><p>Keep information from earlier in the question in the back of your mind. That information can be helpful for you to deduce the answer in combination with newer clues.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class="strategy-item">
          <div class="strategy-number">08</div>
          <div><h3>Always Buzz After the Full Question</h3><p>In the preliminaries and regionals, always buzz in after the question finishes. There will never be a penalty for doing so, and you can at least guess at the answer. Since the question goes "dead" and cannot be answered after 3 wrong answers, you could prevent others from getting a shot at the question too.</p></div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="section-icon">🗂️</div>
      <h2>How I Make Flashcards for Memorization</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Flashcards are my #1 study tool, but most people make them wrong. Here's my system for cards that actually stick.</p>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Always Write Your Own Flashcards</h3>
          <p>Always type or write your own flashcards! Typing your flashcards yourself will significantly help with recall, as writing is proven to help with memorization. Delegating your flashcard creation to AI, online tools, or others may seem helpful, but it will hinder your long term memory of the topic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>One Clue Per Card</h3>
          <p>Make sure each flashcard has only one clue which can lead you to the answer. This clue should be all you need to get the answer.</p>
          <p><strong>✅ Good:</strong> <em>"This man was the third President of the United States."</em> → Thomas Jefferson. One clue, one answer.</p>
          <p><strong>❌ Bad:</strong> <em>"This man wrote the Declaration of Independence, presided over the Louisiana Purchase, and was the First Secretary of State."</em> — Too many clues. You might get it right knowing only one, which won't help in a competition.</p>
          <p><strong>❌ Bad:</strong> <em>"This man died in 1826."</em> — Could be multiple answers. John Adams also died in 1826 (on the same day, July 4).</p>
          <p>This framework may lead to many flashcards for the same answer — that's fine! Once you know the material, you'll move through them quickly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Make Flashcards After Studying</h3>
          <p>Write flashcards after you finish studying the material. If you make flashcards while still learning a topic, you split your attention and may not get a full understanding. Making flashcards after also acts as a review — you have to recall what you learned while creating them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Skip What You Already Know</h3>
          <p>Don't make flashcards for things you knew before studying and feel certain you won't forget. For example, a flashcard asking "Who was the first president of the United States?" will probably be unnecessary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Build Review Time Into Your Routine</h3>
          <p>Flashcards aren't very helpful if you don't review them regularly. Make sure to set aside time when studying to review so that you don't forget things you've previously learned. Consistency in reviewing is key.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Keep Flashcards Organized</h3>
          <p>I use different decks based on region: European, US, North/South American (not US), Asian, and African history. You can also use tags to organize cards this way. By doing this, you can identify which areas are weaker and stronger and analyze your abilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Use Anki for Spaced Repetition</h3>
          <p>I use Anki for my flashcards because it has a good spaced repetition program and lets you customize how often flashcards are shown. Whatever tool you use, make sure it reviews cards at regular intervals based on how many times you get them right — this is the most efficient memorization method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Flashcards Don't Replace Understanding</h3>
          <p>Learning history as a story is the best way to study and will help you memorize much of the information you need. It is better to remember the bigger picture of what happened than to focus on dates and names without knowing how they fit together. Flashcards are just to help you remember details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Don't Over-Focus on Dates</h3>
          <p>Memorizing dates is often a poor use of time. Except for the biggest dates (July 4 for independence, September 11 for the attacks), focus on years or time periods rather than exact dates. For example, you don't need to remember that World War I began on July 28, 1914 — just know the war began in 1914 and fighting ended in 1918.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Card Things You Find Interesting</h3>
          <p>Make flashcards for things you find interesting. This serves two purposes: it makes flashcards more fun, which matters when you're reviewing them regularly. And interesting or strange facts often pop up early in History Bee questions — if you find a fact interesting, the question writers might too.</p>
